view/run old discord builds.

### How to use

Run `launch.bat` or use `node displunger` to launch the web app.
Visit `http://localhost:3000/launch/<BUILD HASH>` to view a build.

### Old Builds
The oldest build we can currently launch is `21837 (10b6c00342136bb3324d2d694b86050ae915017b)`.
Really old builds (roughly early 2018) have since been unpubished and cannot be loaded anymore.

Many older builds fail to function properly due to breaking changes made to the API.
