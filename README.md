view and run old discord builds.

### How to use

Run `launch.bat` or use `node displunger` to launch the web app.
Visit `http://localhost:3000/launch/<BUILD HASH>` to view a build.

### Old Builds
Due to changes in discord's gateway made in 2019, the oldest build we can currently launch is `32750 (89cba7e316f79e01150272f8a74199ea9eada797)`.
Really old builds (roughly early 2018) have since been unpubished and cannot be loaded anymore.

Many older builds fail to function properly due to breaking changes made to the API.
